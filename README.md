## Description

This project is a Rock Paper Scissors app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app is a digital version of the classic game where players can choose between rock, paper, and scissors, and the app determines the winner based on the chosen moves. This project was undertaken to practice front-end development skills and to create an interactive game using JavaScript.

The app allows players to enjoy a quick game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.

## Features
